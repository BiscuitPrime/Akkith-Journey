# Akkith-Journey

*Akkith's Journey* is an in-development simple **event/turn-based game** developped in **Java**. Throught a console, live an adventure as **Akkith**, a warrior of Terra trying to cross the deadly land of Sip Eort to make it back to the Golden Armies of Light.

The player will face a series of events chosen proceduraly as to ensure a new experience every session. The player will have to choose between simple actions as to survive.


The purpose of this project is to manipulate **Java** and more-thourough damage calculations and interactions. As such, the game will not have an interface apart from the console.
